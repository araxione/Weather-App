# Weather App

Weather App is a simple weather forecast app that enables the user to search for a specific location and displays its current temperature, its highest and lowest temperatures, its humidity level and its wind speed.

Our project makes use of the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the data at the specific location entered by the user and is implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
