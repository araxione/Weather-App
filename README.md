# Weather App

Our Weather App is a tool that enables users to search for any city in the world and displays the city's weather forecast data. This data includes the current temperature, the highest and lowest possible temperatures, the humidity level and the wind speed.

This app makes use of the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch data at the specific location entered by the user and is implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Our app also contains a hyperlink to another website that provides users with several links to various websites and blogs. These links can help users decide on activities to do during certain weather conditions. 

The secondary website is implemented using HTML.
