# Weather App

Weather App is a simple weather forecast app that enables the user to search for a specific location and displays its current temperature, its highest and lowest temperatures, its humidity level and its wind speed.

Our project makes use of the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the data at the specific location entered by the user and is implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Our app also contains a hyperlink to another website that provides users with several links to various websites and blogs. These links can help users decide on activities to do during certain weather conditions.

The secondary website is implemented using HTML.
